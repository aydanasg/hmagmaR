**
How to Install: 

1. `remotes::install_github("aydanasg/hmagmaR")`
2. Note that, HMAGMA_system/magma binary file is for mac OS, if you want to run it for your own OS,

    and replace `magma` binary with the correct one.
    Your should be able to execute the binary file with `./magma` command
    Then copy path to magma binary file and put as a variable to `GeneLevelAnalysis_hmagma()` function
3. Please create PRs to main branch instead of direct commit

Example:
```
hmagmaR::GeneLevelAnalysis_hmagma(
  magma="/.../magma",
  g1000="/.../g1000_eur",
  gwas="/.../{fileName}.tsv",
  AnnotationFile="/.../{fileName}.transcript.annot",
  output="/.../outputFolder")
